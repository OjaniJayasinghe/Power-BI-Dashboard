# Power-BI-Dashboard

Three interactive Power BI dashboards I designed, delivering key insights for data-driven decision-making. This project features:


📊 Sales Performance Dashboard – Visualizing revenue trends, product performance, and customer insights to optimize business growth.

🌍 Regional Analysis Dashboard – Mapping sales distribution across locations to identify high-performing regions and market opportunities.

📈 Dynamic Metrics & Interactivity – Providing real-time filtering, drill-down capabilities, and customizable reports for in-depth analysis.


With these dashboards, businesses can make informed decisions with clear, data-backed visuals.
